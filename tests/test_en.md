# English

In English, there is no space becore colon : semicolon ; exclamation mark ! interrogation mark ? or full stop .

Also, too much spaces,       this is not nice…

We also like nice ellips...

Also, we prefer curved apostrophe, is't it? And also curved "quotation marks".

Otherwise, in markdown, one have to be careful not to correct everything. We avoid touching at:

- Equations:
\begin{equation}
dfkjsdfl      kdlsfjskldfj!!!
\end{equation}
Also for inline equations $y=f(x)$.
But if there is only one dollard sign per ligne, everythiong works fine: 1000$ it's expensive…


- In images:
![Image caption should have their typo checked !](/images/kinea.png)

<figure>
 <img src="./images/kinea.png">
 <figcaption>Image caption should have their typo checked !</figcaption>
</figure>
