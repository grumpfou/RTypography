# ORGAN DONATION: FACT AND FICTION

SLOGAN     : ORGAN DONATION...WHEN DEATH GRANTS LIFE

For many of those who live with irreversible organ damage, an organ
transplant represents their only alternative for survival or achieving a
better standard of living. An organ transplant consists in exchanging a
non-functioning organ       or tissue for a healthy one removed from a donor.

Unfortunately, there is a severe shortage of organs ready for
transplant. Years can pass before a patient receives the organ they so
direly need and many die without ever receiving one. 2015 estimates show
that approximately only 10% of the global need for organ transplants is
currently being met [^3].

Since many necessary organs and tissues cannot be donated while the
donor is alive, the only way to increase organ transplants is for more
people to donate their organs after death. Therefore, this article
focuses on post-mortem organ donation.

The post-mortem donation rate differs among countries due to religious,
cultural, and legal differences as well as health systems. Using
official data from 2015, the following map shows where countries stand
relative to number of post-mortem donors for every million residents
(ppm). As you can see, generally speaking the donation rate is not
dependent on each country's economic development or geographic zone.
Ever since the 90s, Spain has been the world leader in organ donation,
even though it is not the most economically developed country on the
list.

These figures represent the number of donors for every million residents
(ppm). In 2015, 119,873 transplants were performed worldwide, a 1.65%
increase from the previous year; these transplants were made possible
thanks to 27,397 donors [^3].</figcaption>

## How does organ donation work?

In order to declare a person medically deceased, there must be
cardiorespiratory arrest or brain death (i.e. the complete and
irreversible loss of brain function); the latter allows for the donation
of more organs, as shown in the following diagram.


<figure>

 <figcaption>Viable tissues and organs for donation from a person declared brain
dead or after cardiorespiratory arrest. Cardiorespiratory arrest can be
caused by a heart attack, deep hypothermia, shock, head trauma,
electrocution, severe hemorrhage or dehydration while brain death is due
to head trauma or stroke. Many more donations are due to brain death
than cardiorespiratory arrest. For example, 2015 official data shows
that Spain had 6.8 donations per million residents (ppm) due to
cardiorespiratory arrest and 33.4 due to brain death; in Malaysia -
which is last amongst countries who keep records - there were no
donations due to cardiorespiratory arrest and 1 ppm due to brain death
that year [^1].</figcaption>
</figure>


In both instances, death must occur in a hospital equipped with the
necessary equipment to preserve the organs (maintain hypothermia and
supply potassium) and perform the necessary assessments so the medical
team can rule whether the deceased can be a donor or not. There is a
time limit on organ preservation before transplant which varies across
organs and tissues (from hours to days).

In Spain, there are three types of criteria which dictate the process of
donating and transplanting an organ or tissue: clinical, equity and
territory. The main clinical criteria are donor-recipient compatibility
and the severity of the recipient's condition. There also exist certain
donor contraindications such as the existence of HIV and current or
recent risk factors of HIV or neoplasia (cancer). The equity criterion
refers to the right of all people to access the same transplant
opportunities. Finally, the territory criterion aims to reduce the
timeframe between organ extraction and transplant and states that the
recipient must be in the same geographical area as the donor [^2].

Possible organ donors are advised to have a signed donor card to as a
testament to their wishes. However, these have no legal standing and
when the time comes, the family must authorize the organ extraction via
a legal consent. It is important for potential organ donors to discuss
their wishes with family members because if the family does not agree
with the donor's decision, they can block the donation even with a valid
donor card.

## Why wouldn't people donate their organs?

Different studies around the world have identified a variety of reasons
why people are not willing to become donors. The main reasons reported
are found below, although some might be more prevalent in some cultures
than in others.

1. While no religion formally forbids donation, the belief that **some
religions disapprove of organ donations** [^4], still prevails [^5].
Therefore, some religious people might be reluctant to donate due to a
misinterpretation of their particular tenets. On the other hand, some
religions are divided and have different schools of thoughts that
disagree on organ donation.

2. The belief that **age is a limiting factor in donation** [^6].
Despite how widespread this idea is, organ donation is possible and
useful regardless of age (although not for all organs). In fact, in
Spain more than 50% of donors in 2014 were older adults [^7].

3. The idea that **donation involves mutilation or disfigurement and**
the **body must remain intact after death** [^8] <sup>,</sup>[^9]. There are certain
rituals that require an intact body after death. In fact, recent studies
carried out amongst Chinese youth [^10] and North American natives
[^11] have found that many desire to donate organs but are held back
due to traditional beliefs that highlight the importance of maintaining
an intact body. It is worth mentioning that the removal of organs for
transplantation is performed with aesthetic surgical incisions and the
body is returned to the family in a suitable state for any ritual to be
performed.

4. A **lack of trust in the management of the organ donation process**
[^6]. This distrust may be due to medical negligence or corruption.
There are even people who fear donating because of organ trafficking,
which is an extreme occurrence even in a corrupt environment [^12]. The
purpose of this article is not to get bogged down in discussing organ
trafficking but it is worth mentioning that this is a separate issue
than a person deciding whether they want to be a donor or not.

5. The belief that an extraction takes place before death due to the
fact that **brain death does not represent a true death** [^13].
Generally, people tend to confuse brain death with a vegetative state or
coma (a person in a coma has severe brain damage but still shows signs
of neurological activity, while a diagnosis of brain death means there
is no neurological activity at all).

## When wishes and facts do not match

Different studies carried out in various parts of the world have asked
people if they are willing to become organ donors upon their death and
the majority answer yes, they are willing [^9]<sup>,</sup>[^14]. However,
just because someone agrees to become an organ donor doesn't necessarily
imply that the donation will take place, as there are circumstances that
can impede it, such as:

a\) a person may not die in a hospital with the requisite personnel or
infrastructure to carry out the donation process; b) the donor may have
medical reasons that prevent donating, as described above; and c) the
family does not authorize the donation which might be due to a lack of
communication from the patient to their family. The family might not be
ready for this type of decision so soon after death, the ideal moment
for organ viability, or the family might not agree with organ donation
even if the deceased wished to donate.

Another factor that might explain the apparent contradiction in the high
percentage of people willing to donate versus the lack of organs donated
is the nature of a formal survey where it is common for the respondent
to give socially "accepted" responses. In this case, organ donation is
seen as a charitable act and a positive response is considered the right
thing to answer.

## Final thoughts

Prejudice, lack of knowledge, and distrust are all barriers that hinder
organ donation. It may take years to tackle these problems but it is
time to begin. There are successful cases such as Spain, where the
government has carried out efforts to increase the rate of organ
donation and transplants with encouraging results. From 1989 to 2015 the
rate of donation in this country increased from 14.3 to 40.2 ppm.

Many countries, such as Portugal, Croatia, Belgium, Italy, France and
some Latin American countries, have been inspired by Spain's success and
managed to increase their donation rates [^7].

Part of the success of the Spanish model lies in making the State a part
of the solution and having them manage organ donation and transplants.
These were previously managed by private or volunteer organizations but
now the Ministry of Health has taken over administering a system that
benefits the population as a whole. It is worth pointing out that the
work of multidisciplinary teams is indispensable since all parts of the
donation and transplant process have medical, social, psychological,
ethical and legal implications.

The National Transplant Organization in Spain (ONT) has set out various
recommendations for hospital coordination teams in regards to the ideal
profile of a hospital Transplant Coordinator, how to improve the
effectiveness of patient referrals and patient care in intensive care
units, and how to improve the process of obtaining donation consent
[^15]. These include training the Transplant Coordinator in identifying
donors, contacting and providing adequate guidance for the family, and
making sure that the donation is carried out. It is clear that the
Coordinator is key to the strength and success of the Spanish system.
